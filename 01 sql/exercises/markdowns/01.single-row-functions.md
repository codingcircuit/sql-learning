### Column info:  

- Order_Desc column is having Uppercase/Lower case/alpha-nuemeric data.
- Order_Type column is having Uppercase/Lower case/nuemeric/printable character data including =+.>


### Assessment:  



1. Please write select statement to produce records whose Order_Desc is in Upper case
   
    ```if numbers are there, they can also be considered```
1. Please write select statement to produce records whose Order_Desc do not have any numbers
   
    ```
   hint:
    Can use Nested replace to replace 0-9 digits and compare string to original
    ```
1. Please write select statement to produce records whose Order_Desc starting with number (0-9)
   
    ```
   hint:
    can use substr to extract 1st character and compare it with 0-9 digits
    ```
1. Find the Max length of order_desc
1. Write SQL to produce records whose Order_Type (single character) is exist with in Order_Desc atleast once
   
   ```case sensitive```  
 
   ```
    example:
    Order_Id 2500 Order_Desc 'IRpsNlBwP' has Order_Type 'P' in it at the end.
   ```
1. Write SQL to produce records whose Order_Type (single character) is exist with in Order_Desc atleast once
   
   ```case in-sensitive```
   
   ```example: including above example in e Order_Id 300 Order_Desc 'ZCSTKWDFB' has Order_Type 'w' in it.```  
1. Write SQL to produce records whose last character Order_Desc is same as Order_type
  
   ```Case insensitive```
1. Write SQL to produce records whose Order_Type is not lower case or Upper case.
   ```
   example: 
   7200	cxelOdte	= 
   3300	AaFpvqoCM	6
   ```  
   ```
    applying lower/upper on values such as 6 or + or similar, will not change anything.  
    so '6' = upper('6') = lower('6')
   ```  
1. List the records whose Delivery_Date is within 30 Days from Order_date.
1. List the records whose Delivery_Date is within 3 months from Order_date.
1. List the records whose Delivery_Date and Order_date is on same day
    ```
    Example:    Both on 4th
    200	MPE1TJ1Q	j	04-FEB-23	04-JAN-24
    ```
1. List the records whose Delivery_Date and Order_date happened in same quarter of the same Year.
1. List the records whose Delivery_Date and Order_date happened in same quarter Even if Year is different
1. List the records whose Delivery_Date is just one day before end of that month.
    ```
    Example: 31-May is last day of May, delivery happened just a day before on 30-May
    7200	cxelOdte	=	10-MAR-23	30-MAY-23
    ```

1. List the records whose overall amount is positive.
    ```
    Example:
    Order Id 100 has total amount -1020  (this should not come)
    Order Id 200	has total amount 3980 (this should come)
    ```     
1. Pleasr find the age of the Order (which is number of days it took to deliver from the date of Order in Days)
    ```
    Example:
    below order took 215 days after Order date to get Delivered
    100	SMBJkCP	U	10-FEB-23	13-SEP-23	0
    ```



1. Display amount in 9,99 format
    ```
    Example:
    amount -330 should reflect as -3,30
    ```

1. Display amount in $999 format
    ```
    Example:
    amount -330 should reflect as -$330
    ```

1. List the Orders that are delivered on the second day of Month
    ```
    Example: 
    9800	hUzmfd	i	22-JAN-23	02-MAR-23
    ```

1. Populate the Week of the Year that Order is delivered.
    ```
    Example: below record delivered on 35th Week of Year
    6100	bZEkQGtw	B	19-FEB-23	31-AUG-23	0
    ```

1. Please provide year wise, Quarter Wise, Month Wise number of orders and total amounts based on Order date.
    ```
    Example:
    "YEAR"	"QTR"	"ORDER_COUNT"	"TOTAL_AMOUNT"
    2022	"1"	        7	        510
    2022	"2"	        14	        -400
    2022	"3"	        12	        20
    2022	"4"	        10	        -410
    ```


1. display the delievery Date and Order Date in 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    ```
    Example:
    100	SMBJkCP	U	'2023-02-10'	'2023-09-13'
    ```


1. Display the Order_ids that are having only one Order Desc mapped to them.
    ```
    Example:
      ORDER_ID
      500
      600
      1000
    ```
1. Display the Average of Total for Each Order. Avarge should not have any decimal places and it should be rounded up
    ```
    Example:
    Order_Id: 100	actual average(-113.33) desired value(-114)
    Order_Id: 200	actual average(221.11)	desired value(221)
    ```
